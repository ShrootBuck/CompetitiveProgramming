# USACO Repository

This repository serves as a personal storage for my USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) materials, including solutions, notes, and whiteboard sketches.

## Overview

- **Solutions**: Code solutions to USACO problems, organized by year or platform. Some problems may have multiple solutions with different time complexities (e.g., an O(nÂ²) brute force solution and an optimized O(n) approach).
- **Whiteboardings**: PNG files of diagrams and sketches. Importantly, all PNG whiteboardings are embedded with Excalidraw information, allowing you to upload them directly to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to access and edit the full vector data. Note that not all problems have associated whiteboards; usually, easier problems do not.

Feel free to explore the directories for specific problem solutions and notes.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and navigate through the folders to find the relevant materials.

To edit a whiteboard PNG:

1. Download the PNG.
2. Go to Excalidraw.
3. Upload the PNG to import the embedded data.
