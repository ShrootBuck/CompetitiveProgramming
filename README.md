# USACO Repository

This repository serves as a personal storage for my USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) materials, including solutions, notes, and whiteboard sketches.

## Overview

- **Solutions**: Code solutions to USACO problems, organized by year or platform.
  - For each problem, the first attempt is named with the base filename (e.g., `cownomics.cpp`).
  - If I optimize or try a different approach, I create a new file with an incremented suffix (e.g., `cownomics-2.cpp`, `cownomics-3.cpp`).
- **Whiteboardings**: PNG files of diagrams and sketches. Importantly, all PNG whiteboardings are embedded with Excalidraw information, allowing you to upload them directly to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to access and edit the full vector data. Note that not all problems have associated whiteboards; usually, easier problems do not.

Feel free to explore the directories for specific problem solutions and diagrams.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and navigate through the folders to find the relevant materials.

To edit a whiteboard PNG:

1. Download the PNG file
2. Go to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
3. Upload the PNG to import the embedded data
