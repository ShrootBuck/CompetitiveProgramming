# Competitive Programming Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive for my competitive programming journey, including solutions, notes, and whiteboard sketches from various platforms.

## Overview

- **Solutions**: Code solutions to problems from platforms like USACO, Codeforces, CSES, LeetCode, Project Euler, and Advent of Code. The problems are organized by platform and then by contest or problem set.
  - If a problem consists of a single file, it is simply named with the problem name (e.g., `problem.cpp`).
  - If a problem has multiple associated files (such as whiteboard sketches or multiple solution versions) it's stored in a folder named after the problem. Inside, you might find files like `problem/1.cpp`, `problem/2.cpp`, and `problem/Sketch.png`. Note that these numbered solutions are incremental; `2.cpp` is an optimized and/or improved version of `1.cpp`.
- **Whiteboardings**: PNG files of diagrams and sketches. Importantly, all PNG whiteboardings are embedded with Excalidraw information, allowing you to upload them directly to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to access and edit the full vector data. Note that not all problems have associated whiteboards; usually, easier problems do not.

Feel free to explore the directories for specific problem solutions and diagrams.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and navigate through the folders to find the relevant materials.

To edit a whiteboard PNG:

1. Download the PNG file
2. Go to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
3. Upload the PNG to import the embedded data

## A Note on Commit Timestamps

You might see a commit timestamp that makes it look like I posted a solution during a contest. That's just because I commit locally while I'm working. I don't actually push anything to GitHub until after the contest is over, and I also try to delay my local commits until after the contest to avoid this entirely.
